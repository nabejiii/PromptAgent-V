"A realistic nighttime cityscape with a mix of architectural designs, including a prominent twisted skyscraper. The scene is illuminated with a balanced mix of warm and cool white lights, and highlighted with touches of blue and yellow on select buildings.

The illumination is not overly warm, but rather a mix of warm and cooler white lights, with some buildings highlighted by blue and yellow-colored lights. There's also a bustling city vibe with lit buildings in the foreground, not just the skyscrapers. The river has lively reflections that are not excessively extended, suggesting a slight disturbance in the water, possibly from a gentle breeze or river traffic."
