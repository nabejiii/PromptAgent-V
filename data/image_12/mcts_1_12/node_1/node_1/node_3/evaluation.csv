"A photorealistic nighttime cityscape with a varied skyline, featuring a harmony of architectural styles and heights. The scene is bathed in soft, golden ambient lighting, with individual sources contributing to a gentle illumination of the buildings. The lights cast subtle, accurate reflections on the still surface of a river. Ensure a clear, starless night sky to maintain the scene's calmness. Aim for a natural and subdued color balance with restrained use of light reflection on the water, to capture a serene and authentic urban atmosphere.","The first image depicts a real-world cityscape at night with a clear, dark sky and numerous buildings lit with a variation of golden and blue lights reflecting off the calm river surface. There are no stars visible in the sky, and the ambience of the scene is tranquil and peaceful. The generated second image, on the other hand, has an exaggerated contrast with more intense and varied lighting, a star-laden sky, and a fantastical cloud formation, which gives it a more surreal appearance. The river reflection in the second image is also more pronounced with brighter, more varied colors."
