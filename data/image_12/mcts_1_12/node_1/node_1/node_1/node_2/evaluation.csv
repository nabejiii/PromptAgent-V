"A photorealistic nighttime cityscape with a clear, dark sky and a medley of architectural styles, ranging from modern glass skyscrapers to historic edifices. The buildings are subtly lit by warm golden lights with varying intensities, fostering a calm and appealing environment. The architecture is mirrored on the tranquil river below, with accurate, soft reflections showcasing the quietude of the scene. Emphasize authentic light reflection on the water for a realistic portrayal, sustain a naturally muted color scheme, and evoke a sense of peace in an urban landscape at a starless night.","The first image shows a realistic night cityscape with distinct architectural styles, including modern glass skyscrapers and traditional buildings, with natural-looking golden and white lights. The reflections in the water are subtle and accurately mirror the colors and shapes of the city lights. The sky is clear and dark, indicating a starless night, consistent with the original prompt.
