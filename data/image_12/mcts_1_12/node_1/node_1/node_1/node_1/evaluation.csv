"A photorealistic nighttime cityscape with a naturally dark sky free of stars. The scene features a blend of architectural styles, including modern glass skyscrapers and traditional buildings, all illuminated with soft, warm lighting that offers a realistic, appealing glow. The light from the buildings casts subtle, accurate reflections on the calm river below, avoiding overly vibrant or glaring effects. Maintain a realistic color palette emphasizing natural nighttime hues, with an emphasis on the authenticity of lighting and reflection to capture a serene and inviting urban environment at night.","The first image shows a more natural and less saturated color palette with a realistic nighttime feel, while the second image exhibits highly saturated and somewhat artificial colors, creating a more fantastical rather than realistic atmosphere. In the first image, the lights on the buildings are more subtle and diffuse, lacking the intense glares present in the second image. The reflections in the water in the first image are also more gentle and accurate to the sources of light, whereas in the second image, they are exaggerated and overly vibrant. The first image does not include any star effects in the sky, maintaining a starless aspect, whereas the second image has a certain glow that suggests a hint of stars or other light sources."
