It is set against a background of a densely wooded hill with no visible residential buildings on the hill itself. There are trees to the right and behind the shed, but no visible parked cars or clear indication of a residential area directly adjacent to the shed. The sky is bright blue with a few faint clouds, and there are utility poles and electric wires prominently on the right. The ground in front of the shed appears to be a gravel or dirt area rather than a patch of grass."
