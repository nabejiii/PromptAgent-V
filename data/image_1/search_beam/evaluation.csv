1,"A clear day with a small, fully-enclosed wooden shack in the center surrounded by a trim grass lawn and a border of pebbles. Include Japanese-style houses in the middle ground, with multiple utility poles and lush greenery. In the background, there should be a green, densely-forested mountain and a cloudless blue sky.","The first image depicts a wooden shack with doors in the center, surrounded by a grassy area with a pebble border. There are residential Japanese-style houses at mid-ground and multiple utility poles, with a densely-wooded green mountain in the background and a clear blue sky. The second image shows a building that is partially open and missing walls, with construction material inside, surrounded by a grassy area with no clear pebble border.
